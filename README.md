CS294 Project: Galaxy Sky Spaxel Logger

This program serves four purposes:

1) Logs spaxels that contain sky background based on user input, and outputs these spaxels into a text file that can be used to subtract sky spectra from the overall galaxy spectra.

2) Helps diagnose spaxels that are unclear to user whether or not they contain sky spectra.

3) Outputs visual 15x15 grid that displays where the sky spaxels are in the cube (or lack thereof).

4) Outputs documentation of spaxel diagnostics (if diagnostics were needed).
